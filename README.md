# Automatic speech bubble script for GIMP

This script draws speech bubbles around text layers. Because this script was developed specifically for my specific needs, here's features and limitations. 

## Features

* This script will draw a "speech bubble" around a layer of text.
* If this script is ran while layer group is selected, it will draw speech bubbles around all layers in the layer group. 
* The script will draw either kinda-rectangle or ellipse and fill it with a color of your choosing

## Limitations

* It's currently **NOT** in a working state. DO NOT USE, it'll do nothing at all.
* It will only draw the bubble.
* It will **NOT** draw the tails
* It will **NOT** draw the outline 
* Every text layer is treated as a single bubble. Don't put multiple bubbles' worth of text on a single layer.
